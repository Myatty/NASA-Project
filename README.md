# NASA-Project
The NASA project utilizes the MERN stack: MongoDB for data storage, Express.js for server-side tasks, React.js for building the user interface, and Node.js for server runtime. Mongoose simplifies MongoDB interactions, while npm scripts handle tasks like installation and deployment.

This Repo is currently empty as the project is way much Bigger and can't be uploaded in time, still figuring things out. And improving the performance of Node.

## Still in Progress
